### TODO 
- adding roles to users should be a users/{id}/adduser. Currently is been done via POST with a hidden field.
- in DealersController.show the array for non contact dispositions should be dynamic.
- DealsController.appointment setting the disposition should be dynamic
- DealerController.repairorders_month is calculating the RO Total Amount in the view... now sure if its better there or perhaps a ->sum(amount).
